# Pediatric Emergency Warning Signs & Poisoning Management: Complete Guide

This comprehensive guide helps parents and caregivers recognize critical emergency signs and manage poisoning situations in children. Understanding these warning signs and knowing how to respond can save your child's life. **Trust your instincts—if something doesn't feel right, seek medical help immediately.**

## Understanding Emergency Priorities

Emergency conditions in children can be broadly classified into two categories:
- **General Medical Emergencies** - including sepsis, breathing problems, severe injuries
- **Poisoning Emergencies** - including medication overdose, household chemicals, snake bites, gas inhalation

Both require immediate recognition and appropriate response for the best outcomes.
