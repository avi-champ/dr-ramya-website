# Diarrhea Management: A Comprehensive Guide for Families

Diarrhea is one of the most common health conditions worldwide, affecting people of all ages. This comprehensive guide provides evidence-based information about diarrhea prevention, proper management, hygiene practices, and when to seek medical attention.

## Understanding Diarrhea

Diarrhea is defined as three or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequent bowel movements than normal for an individual. It's typically a symptom of an underlying condition rather than a disease itself.

### Types of Diarrhea

**Acute Diarrhea:**
- Lasts less than 14 days
- Usually caused by infections (viral, bacterial, parasitic)
- Most common type, often self-limiting
- Accounts for approximately 90% of diarrhea cases

**Persistent Diarrhea:**
- Lasts 14-29 days
- May indicate more serious underlying conditions
- Requires medical evaluation
- Can lead to significant nutritional deficiencies

**Chronic Diarrhea:**
- Lasts 30 days or longer
- Often indicates chronic gastrointestinal conditions
- Requires thorough medical investigation
- May be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, or other conditions

### Common Causes

**Infectious Causes (Most Common):**
- **Viral:** Norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus
- **Bacterial:** Salmonella, Campylobacter, E. coli, Shigella, Clostridium difficile
- **Parasitic:** Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Entamoeba histolytica

**Non-Infectious Causes:**
- Food intolerances (lactose intolerance, fructose malabsorption)
- Medications (antibiotics, antacids, chemotherapy)
- Dietary factors (artificial sweeteners, excessive caffeine)
- Stress and anxiety
- Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
- Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)

## Age-Specific Management Guidelines

### Infants (0-12 months)

**Special Considerations:**
- Infants are at highest risk for dehydration
- Breastfed babies have more frequent, loose stools normally
- Formula-fed babies typically have firmer, less frequent stools
- Diarrhea in infants can be life-threatening

**Management for Breastfed Infants:**
- Continue breastfeeding on demand
- Offer additional breast milk between regular feedings
- Do not dilute breast milk or formula
- Monitor for signs of dehydration closely

**Management for Formula-Fed Infants:**
- Continue regular formula feeding
