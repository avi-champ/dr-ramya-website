## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: How often should I feed my newborn?**
**A:** Breastfed babies need 8-12 feeds per 24 hours. Formula-fed babies typically feed every 2-4 hours. Follow your baby's hunger cues rather than strict schedules.

### **Q: Is it normal for my baby to lose weight after birth?**
**A:** Yes, newborns typically lose 5-10% of their birth weight in the first few days. They should regain this weight by 2 weeks of age. Your pediatrician will monitor this closely.

### **Q: How do I know if my baby is getting enough milk?**
**A:** Signs include: regular wet diapers (6+ per day after day 3), steady weight gain, baby seems satisfied after feeds, and you can hear swallowing during breastfeeding.

### **Q: When should I start tummy time?**
**A:** Start tummy time from the first day home, but only when baby is awake and supervised. Begin with 2-3 minutes, several times per day.

### **Q: How can I tell if my baby is too hot or cold?**
**A:** Feel your baby's chest or the back of their neck. Hands and feet may be cool, but this is normal. Dress baby in one more layer than you're comfortable wearing.

### **Q: Is it safe to co-sleep with my newborn?**
**A:** The AAP recommends room-sharing without bed-sharing. Keep baby's sleep area in your room but on a separate surface designed for infants.

### **Q: What should I do if my baby won't stop crying?**
**A:** Check for hunger, dirty diaper, too hot/cold, or need for comfort. Try swaddling, gentle movement, or white noise. If crying is excessive or unusual, contact your pediatrician.

**A:** 2-3 times per week is sufficient for newborns. Give sponge baths until the umbilical cord heals, then you can use a baby bathtub.
